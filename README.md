#Agenda

Hi! welcome you to the agenda, in this program we can add tasks to perform and events to occur.

Both tasks and events inherit the name and description attributes of their parent class. Both classes have their own attributes, these being for task: status and for event: start date and hour and finish date and hour.

The task and event parent class is an activity that stores a vector with the objects, in this case, the task or event that the user creates or that are defined in the program.
